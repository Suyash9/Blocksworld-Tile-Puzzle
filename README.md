# Blocksworld-Tile-Puzzle
An ‘agent’ moves in a simulated NxN grid world with the goal of building towers of blocks. Each grid space contains either a ‘tile’ or the agent. Some tiles have letters on them – these are the ‘blocks’. All the other tiles are white. The agent moves up/down/left/right (except where borders prevent it). As the agent moves, the tile that they move onto slides under them into the position that they just came from. 
Implemented the following types of search to solve this problem: depth first, breadth first, iterative deepening, A* heuristic search.
